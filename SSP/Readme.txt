1. Introduction
----------------
SSP is supposed to be a handy tool doing parameter studies using the public
tools SPheno, WHIZARD, HiggsBounds, CalcHep and MicrOmegas.


2. Download and installation
----------------------------
The package can be downloaded from 

    http://theorie.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~fnstaub/SSP.html

and should be extracted to the application directory of Mathematica. This directory is Linux
    home/user/.Mathematica/Applications/
and
    Mathematica-Directory\AddOns\Applications\
in Windows. 

3. Evaluation
---------------------------
After the installation, the package is loaded in Mathematica via
     <<"[DIRECTORY]/SSP.m"
and a scan is initialized by 
     Start["Inputfile"];
